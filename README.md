Hello!

To run this project, you can use 'npm run dev' or access it online. 

Once it's running, the UI is pretty intuitive. You can alter variables such as the number of particles, the force of gravity, and more from the UI sliders. Additionally, you can choose from a variety of pre-sets to choose one of 4 galaxy simulations, a galaxy collision, or an expanding universe simulation. 

I took some inspiration from the visuals of N0rvel's galaxy simulation - you can find his project here!
